Output Format

Output: 3 Explanation: The longest substring without repeating characters is "abc", which has a length of 3.

    # Iterate through the string

            start = char_index[char] + 1

        # Update the character's index in the dictionary

        # Calculate the maximum length of the substring without repetitions
        max_length = max(max_length, i - start + 1)

# Example usage
s = "abcabcbb"
print(lengthOfLongestSubstring(s))  # Output: 3
